# ZSH Dotfiles

## Installation

Run `./install` to symlink dotfiles. This repository uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage and install files and symlinks.

Once the files are installed and symlinked, you can edit the files from this repository directly and they will be updated on your system. Remember to restart or open a new terminal after making changes.
